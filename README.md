## links
- **roadmap (public summary):** [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md)
- **demos:** add short clips (60–90s) under `/demo` in each project repo  
  - *(placeholder)* asset atlas — `/demo/asset-atlas-v0.mp4`  
  - *(placeholder)* playlens — `/demo/playlens-v0.mp4`
- **repos:** see the list in [projects](#projects)

## intent
a public, working lab for **content operations in video games**. the goal is to show, not tell: every phase ships something you can click—searchable assets, measured UX wins, actionable player feedback, reliable localization, safe creator intake, and reusable production decisions.

- audience: producers, content leads, ux/ops at game studios  
- principle: **proof over claims** (each claim links to a demo, doc, or metric)

## outcomes
1. **findable assets** — *asset atlas* (search + tags)
2. **proven ux improvements** — *playlens* (test → fix → retest)
3. **player feedback → action** — *patch notes oracle* (themes, sentiment, triage)
4. **text shipped on time** — *localization conveyor* (write → translate → proof → done)
5. **safe creator submissions** — *creator ops kit* (intake, review, recognition)
6. **reusable decisions** — *producer’s almanac* (decision logs, templates)

## roadmap
- public summary: milestones + latest demos → [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md)  
- note: full weekly roadmap and decision logs live privately in confluence; stable summaries land here.

- license: **MIT** (sample assets may have their own licenses; see repo notes).
- practices: ship weekly (at least one deliverable to **done**), WIP cap = **3** in **doing**, evidence-first links.
