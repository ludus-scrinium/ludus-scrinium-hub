## What this is
A public, working lab for **content operations in video games**. Six small systems that make assets findable, UX changes provable, player feedback actionable, text shippable, fan content safe, and decisions reusable.

- **Audience:** producers, content leads, UX/ops folks at game studios
- **Note:** every week adds a link or clip you can click

## Six outcomes
1. **Findable assets** — *Asset Atlas* (search + tags)
2. **Measured UX improvements** — *PlayLens* (test → fix → retest)
3. **Player feedback begets dev action** — *Patch Notes Oracle* (themes, sentiment, triage)
4. **Text shipped on time** — *Localization Conveyor* (write → translate → QA → done)
5. **Safe creator submissions** — *Creator Ops Kit* (intake, review, recognition)
6. **Reusable decisions** — *Producer’s Almanac* (decision logs, templates)

## Roadmap
**Public summary:** see milestones and latest demos here → [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md)  
*(Full weekly roadmap and decision logs live privately in Confluence; summaries land here when they’re stable.)*

## Projects
- **Asset Atlas** — make game files easy to find and reuse, for anyone 
  Repo: https://github.com/ludus-scrinium/asset-atlas
- **PlayLens** — test one screen/flow; show timed improvement  
  Repo: https://github.com/ludus-scrinium/playlens
- **Patch Notes Oracle** — turn player comments into a realistic “to-do” list  
  Repo: https://github.com/ludus-scrinium/patch-notes-oracle
- **Localization Conveyor** — text from write → translate → QA → ship  
  Repo: https://github.com/ludus-scrinium/localization-conveyor
- **Creator Ops Kit** — safe fan content intake + review + recognition  
  Repo: https://github.com/ludus-scrinium/creator-ops-kit
- **Producer’s Almanac** — decisions, retros, templates  
  Repo: https://github.com/ludus-scrinium/producers-almanac

## Demos
Short clips (60–90s). Newest first.
- *(placeholder)* Asset Atlas: filter → find → done — `/demo/asset-atlas-v0.mp4`
- *(placeholder)* PlayLens: before/after — `/demo/playlens-v0.mp4`

> Tip: If a repo has its own demo page (Streamlit, YouTube), link that too.

## Try it in 5 minutes
1. Pick a repo above and open its **`/docs/SETUP.md`**.
2. Run the tiny quick-start (or watch the demo clip).
3. Read the **one-pager** in `/docs` to understand what you’re seeing.

## Practices (how this lab runs)
- **Ship weekly:** at least one deliverable flips to **Done** with a link.
- **WIP cap:** never more than **3** items in **In progress** on the board.
- **Definition of done:** every issue points to a demo, doc, or metric.
