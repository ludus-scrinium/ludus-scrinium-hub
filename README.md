# LUDUS SCRINIUM — Game Content Ops Lab

**Goal:** Show how to manage and ship game content—organized, measurable, and safe.

## Six outcomes
1) Findable assets (Asset Atlas)
2) Proven UX improvements (PlayLens)
3) Player feedback → action (Patch Notes Oracle)
4) Text shipped on time (Localization Conveyor)
5) Safe creator submissions (Creator Ops Kit)
6) Decisions we can reuse (Producer’s Almanac)

## Timeline (44 weeks)
Phase 1: Setup (1–6)  
Phase 2: Two core systems (7–18)  
Phase 3: Player signal (19–26)  
Phase 4: Scale content (27–34)  
Phase 5: Integrate/polish (35–40)  
Phase 6: Validate/ship (41–44)
